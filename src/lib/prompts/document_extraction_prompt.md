When processing payments, you'll be working with several types of user-uploaded documents. Here's a breakdown of what to look for in each:

### Checks
You'll encounter two main types of checks:

- **Personal Checks:** Easily identified by **handwritten key details** like the amount and date.
- **Printed Checks:** Typically issued by organizations, these usually have **printed amounts** rather than handwritten ones.

For both types, pay close attention to the **amount** (both numerical and spelled out), the **check number** (usually in the upper right corner), any **memos**, and the **check date**. Checks often also contain the donor's (and sometimes their spouse's) name and address, which can serve as a backup if address information isn't available elsewhere.

### Envelopes
Envelopes are crucial for **verifying donor contact information**:

- **Return Address:** Always **verify if the return address matches** the donor's entry in your customer contact list. A mismatch could indicate a moved donor, requiring an address update. The **return address on the envelope supersedes all other addresses**, including any found on the check.
- **Additional Contact Info:** Look for any **phone numbers or emails** not already in your customer contact list.
- **Memos:** Donors might write memos on the envelope that aren't on the check. Be sure to include these.

### User Record
The user may provide a **handwritten list of donations** for the current deposit, typically in columns. At a minimum, this record will include a **check number** and **gift amount**. Sometimes, an item number and the donor's name may also be present. The **check number on this user record is authoritative**; always ensure it matches when merging entries.

### Online Donations
For online donations, the user may upload a **.csv file**. In these cases, use the **`Payment_Ref`** as the unique identifier instead of a check number.

## Field Descriptions for Data Extraction

Here's a detailed description of each field you'll be extracting from the user-uploaded data:

### Payment Information

- **Payment Method**: This specifies how the payment was made and is **REQUIRED**. It can be a **handwritten check** (typically corresponding to personal checks with handwritten key details), a **printed check** (typically corresponding to checks with printed amounts), or an **online payment**. Note that online payments are imported via a .csv file.

- **Payment Ref.**: This serves as the **unique identifier for every payment** and is **REQUIRED for ALL payments**.
    * For checks, this is the **check number**. These are typically four digits for personal checks but can be longer for pre-printed checks. The check number from the "User Record," if available, is authoritative.
    * For online donations, this will be a unique **Payment Reference No.** (e.g., from the `Payment_Ref` column in an uploaded .csv).

- **Amount**: This is the monetary value of the payment and is **REQUIRED**. When found on a check, it will be presented numerically and spelled out. You must ensure this is recorded with absolute accuracy.

- **Payment Date**: This is the date the payment was made and is **REQUIRED**. The method of recording this date varies by payment type:
    * **Handwritten Check**: Use the **postmark date** from the envelope. If unavailable or illegible, use the check date.
    * **Printed Check**: Use the **date printed on the check**.
    * **Online Payment**: Use the date the transaction was recorded (e.g., from the .csv file).

- **Check Date**: This is simply the date written on the check itself. Capture this if available, even if it's not chosen as the primary `Payment_Date`.

- **Postmark Date**: This is the date stamped on the envelope by the postal service. Capture this if available and legible (these can sometimes be difficult to read).

- **Deposit Date**: This is the date the payment was deposited into the bank. You'll typically find this on the user's record or a deposit slip.

- **Deposit Method**: This describes how the deposit was made:
    * **For checks**: "ATM Deposit" (or "Mobile deposit" if specified by the user).
    * **For online donations**: "Online" (specify "Stripe" or "Paypal" if that information is available from the .csv or other documentation).

- **Memo**: This field captures any notes written on the **check**, on the **envelope**, or any summary information included with the payment. If memos are present in multiple locations for a single payment, combine them.

### Payer Information

- **Aliases**: This field represents the payer's name and should be a **list** where multiple versions of their full name can be stored. At least one alias is **REQUIRED if the payer is not an organization**. **You MUST generate ALL reasonable variations of the name**, including:
  - Full name as written (e.g., "John A. Smith")
  - Name without middle initial/name (e.g., "John Smith")
  - Last name, First name format (e.g., "Smith, John")
  - Last name, First name with middle (e.g., "Smith, John A.")
  - First initial + Last name (e.g., "J. Smith")
  - Last name, First initial (e.g., "Smith, J.")
  - If middle initial/name exists, include variations with it (e.g., "J. A. Smith", "Smith, J. A.")

  For example, if you see "Jonelle R. Collins" on a check, you MUST generate:
  `["Jonelle R. Collins", "Jonelle Collins", "Collins, Jonelle", "Collins, Jonelle R.", "J. Collins", "Collins, J.", "J. R. Collins", "Collins, J. R."]`

  This comprehensive list ensures proper matching with existing customer records that may use different name formats. Obtain the base name from the check, envelope, or user record, then generate all variations.

- **Salutation**: This indicates how the payer should be addressed and can be inferred from their details (e.g., "Mr. & Mrs." for John and Jane Smith). It can be one or a combination of titles such as "Mr.", "Ms.", "Mr. & Mrs.", "Dr.", "Rev.", or any other title inferred from the provided materials.

- **Organization Name**: This is the name of the organization making the donation and is **REQUIRED for organizations**. You should obtain this from the check or user record, and verify against the customer contact list if possible.

### Contact Information

- **Address - Line 1**: This is the street address of the payer. The return address on the envelope supersedes all other addresses.
- **City**: This is the city component of the address. The return address on the envelope supersedes all other addresses.
- **State**: This is the two-digit state code typically found in any U.S. address. The return address on the envelope supersedes all other addresses.
- **ZIP**: This is the five-digit numerical postal code typically found in any U.S. address. You can usually ignore any additional four-digit extensions. **NOTE**: Be sure to format this field as **text** to preserve any leading zeros. The return address on the envelope supersedes all other addresses.
- **Email**: The email address of the payer. Look for this on **envelopes**, **checks** (less common), or other **provided documentation like user records or .csv files for online donations**. This may supplement or update information in the customer contact list.
- **Phone**: The phone number of the payer. Look for this on **envelopes**, **checks** (less common), or other **provided documentation like user records**. This may supplement or update information in the customer contact list.

### Structured Output JSON Schema

Your output must be JSON and only JSON. Each payment that you extract from the user-uploaded documents should be placed in a JSON object according to the following schema:

```json
[{
  "PaymentInfo": {
    "Payment_Ref": "(REQUIRED for ALL payments: Check Number for checks, Payment Reference No. for online donations)",
    "Payment_Method": "(REQUIRED: 'handwritten check', 'printed check', or 'online payment')",
    "Amount": "(REQUIRED, numeric)",
    "Payment_Date": "(REQUIRED, YYYY-MM-DD)",
    "Check_Date": "(YYYY-MM-DD, if available)",
    "Postmark_Date": "(YYYY-MM-DD, if available)",
    "Deposit_Date": "(YYYY-MM-DD, if available)",
    "Deposit_Method": "('ATM Deposit', 'Mobile deposit', 'Online', 'Stripe', 'Paypal', etc.)",
    "Memo": ""
  },
  "PayerInfo": {
    "Aliases": [], // Note: At least one alias is REQUIRED if the payer is not an organization
    "Salutation": "",
    "Organization_Name": "(REQUIRED for organizations)"
  },
  "ContactInfo": {
    "Address_Line_1": "",
    "City": "",
    "State": "",
    "ZIP": "",
