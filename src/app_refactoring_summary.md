# App.py Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duplicate Functions
The following functions were removed from app.py as they are now imported from the services modules:

- `sanitize_for_logging` (lines 179-214)
- `log_audit_event` (lines 216-234)
- `validate_donation_date` (lines 402-442)
- `validate_environment` (lines 444-485)
- `normalize_check_number` (lines 487-495)
- `normalize_amount` (lines 496-507)
- `normalize_donor_name` (lines 508-515)
- `normalize_date` (lines 516-527)
- `deduplicate_and_synthesize_donations` (lines 528-625)
- `synthesize_donation_data` (lines 627-762)

### 2. Updated Function Calls
- Replaced `deduplicate_and_synthesize_donations()` with `DeduplicationService.deduplicate_donations()`
  - Line 1308: In the file processing route
  - Line 1563: In the update_session_donations function

### 3. Preserved Important Elements
- Kept the `validate_environment()` call at line 485 (now line 348)
- All imports from services.validation and services.deduplication are in place
- The functions are still accessible and used throughout the app

## Result
- Removed ~400 lines of duplicate code
- All functionality preserved through imports
- Code is now more maintainable with clear separation of concerns
- Successfully tested: Python syntax check passes and all imports work correctly
