# V2 Workflow Test Results with Actual Dummy Files

## Summary
Successfully tested the V2 refactored workflow with real dummy files from the test directory. The system correctly:

1. **Called the actual Gemini API** (not mocked)
2. **Extracted payment data** from both PDF and image files
3. **Generated comprehensive aliases** as specified
4. **Matched customers** using alias-based matching
5. **Enriched payment data** with QBO customer information

   - Extracted 4 payments

2. **2025-05-17 12.50.27-1.jpg**
