This image contains donation checks. Extract information from EACH check.

For each check, look for:
- Check number (upper right)
- Date on the check (NOT deposit slip date)
- Amount (in numbers)
- Name (who wrote the check)
- Memo line
- Any envelope with address

Use null if you can't clearly read something.

Return ONLY a JSON array with the donation data.
