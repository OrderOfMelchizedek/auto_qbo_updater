üö® DATE EXTRACTION IS CRITICAL - STOP AND READ üö®
================================================

THIS IMAGE SET CONTAINS:
1. ‚õî A DEPOSIT SLIP with a date - THIS IS THE DEPOSIT DATE ONLY
2. ‚úÖ Individual CHECKS - each has its OWN Check Date  

YOUR MANDATORY PROCESS:
1. The deposit slip date is ONLY for the "Deposit Date" field
2. For EACH check separately:
   - READ the date from that specific check
   - Look in the upper right area (near check number)
   - This is the "Check Date" for that donation
   - NEVER copy one Check Date to multiple donations

VISUAL GUIDE FOR DATES:
- CHECK DATES: Handwritten/printed line near top right of each check (like "5/14/24")
- DEPOSIT DATE: The date on the deposit slip/summary - use ONLY for "Deposit Date" field

‚ö†Ô∏è SELF-CHECK: If you find yourself using the same Check Date for multiple donations, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. Each check has its own date.

IMPORTANT: This image may contain:
- Actual checks (look for check number, date, amount, signature)
- Envelopes with postmarks (look for postal date stamps)
- Handwritten notes or summaries (these are for reference only)

When extracting dates:
- Check Date: Look for the date written on each individual check (usually in the top right corner)
  - This is typically handwritten in formats like "5/14/24" or "May 14, 2024"
  - EACH CHECK HAS ITS OWN DATE - do not use one date for all checks
- Deposit Date: Use the date from the deposit slip (when the batch was deposited at bank)
  - CRITICAL: Each check has its OWN date - do NOT apply one date to all checks
  - Read the SPECIFIC date written on EACH individual check
- For envelopes: Use the postmark date stamp (circular stamp from postal service)
- IGNORE dates on handwritten notes or summaries - these are usually deposit dates, not gift dates
- If no date is visible on a specific check or envelope, use null for that check's dates
- WARNING: If you see "6/1" or similar dates repeated, verify you're reading each check's individual date
