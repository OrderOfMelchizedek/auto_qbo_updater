# Async Processing Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a complete background processing system to solve the Heroku 30-second timeout issue. The solution uses Celery with Redis for job queuing and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time progress updates.

## Key Changes

### 1. Backend Infrastructure

**New Files:**
- `src/celery_app.py` - Celery configuration with Flask integration
- `src/job_tracker.py` - Job status tracking and event publishing
- `src/tasks.py` - Background task for donation processing

**Updated Files:**
- `src/app.py` - Added async endpoints and SSE streaming
- `requirements.txt` - Added `celery==5.3.4`
- `Procfile` - Added worker process for Heroku

### 2. New API Endpoints

- `POST /api/process` - Now returns job_id immediately
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}` - Check job status and results
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}/stream` - SSE endpoint for real-time updates

### 3. Frontend Updates

**Updated Components:**
- `ProcessingStatus.tsx` - Enhanced with progress bar and stage tracking
- `App.tsx` - Updated to handle async job flow

**Updated Services:**
- `api.ts` - Added job status polling and SSE support

### 4. Development Environment

- `scripts/start-dev.sh` - Starts all services (Redis, Celery, Flask, React)
- Same architecture in local and production (no code differences)

## How It Works

1. **File Upload**: User uploads files → immediate response
2. **Job Creation**: Processing queued as background job → job_id returned
3. **Progress Updates**: Frontend connects to SSE or polls for updates
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see progress through stages:
   - Uploading files
   - Extracting donation data
   - Validating donations
   - Matching with QuickBooks
   - Finalizing results

## Benefits

1. **No More Timeouts**: Processing happens in background
2. **Better UX**: Real-time progress updates
3. **Scalability**: Can process multiple uploads concurrently
4. **Reliability**: Failed jobs can be retried
5. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Same code runs everywhere

## Deployment

For Heroku deployment:
1. Provision Redis addon: `heroku addons:create heroku-redis:mini`
2. Scale worker dyno: `heroku ps:scale worker=1`
3. Deploy as usual

## Local Development

1. Install Redis: `brew install redis`
2. Run: `./scripts/start-dev.sh`
3. Access app at http://localhost:3000

The system gracefully falls back to polling if SSE fails, ensuring compatibility across all environments.
