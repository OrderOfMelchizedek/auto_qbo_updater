# Conversation Summary: FOM to QBO Automation Project

## Project Overview
This project implements an OAuth2 client for QuickBooks Online API integration, with a focus on processing FOM (Friends of Music) donation data and creating QBO Sales Receipts.

## Initial Context
The conversation began with a request to continue from a previous session where test failures had been fixed. The starting state showed:
- 60 out of 132 tests failing (pushed to GitHub)
- Need to achieve 100% test pass rate
- Integration with QuickBooks Online API
- File processing using Google Gemini AI service
- Celery for async task processing

## Major Tasks Completed

### 1. Fixed All Test Failures (60 â†’ 0 failures)
**Key Fixes:**
- **MockRedis.set() signature issue**: Fixed to handle both positional and keyword arguments in `tests/conftest.py`
- **Session management**: Properly mocked Flask-Session Redis backend
- **Import errors**: Fixed module import paths using PYTHONPATH
- **Date validation**: Made tests environment-aware for future date limits

**Result**: Achieved 100% test pass rate (150/150 tests passing)

### 2. Test Coverage Analysis
- Ran coverage analysis showing 42% code coverage
- Created `TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` documenting:
  - Unit test coverage: 63%
  - Integration test coverage: 15%
  - Uncovered areas identified for future testing

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks Setup
Installed and configured pre-commit hooks to run:
- Black (code formatter) - fixed line-length mismatch (100 vs 120)
- isort (import sorter)
- flake8 (linter)
- bandit (security scanner)
- mypy (type checker)
- pytest (all tests)

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
**GitHub Actions CI fixes:**
- Added `fetch-depth: 0` for full git history (required for Heroku)
- Fixed Heroku app creation logic
- Added retry logic for health checks
- Fixed authentication using token-based auth

**Heroku Deployment fixes:**
- Fixed PYTHONPATH in Procfile: `PYTHONPATH=src gunicorn src.app:app`
- Added buildpack configuration
- Handled shallow clone issues

### 5. Application Bug Fixes

#### Celery Task Parameter Mismatch
Fixed in `src/routes/files.py`:
```python
# Changed from:
task = process_files_task.delay(file_paths=file_paths, ...)
# To:
task = process_files_task.delay(file_references=file_paths, ...)
```

#### Missing QBO Routes
Added missing routes in `src/routes/qbo.py`:
- `/qbo/environment` - Get current QBO environment
- `/qbo/items/all` - Get all items from QuickBooks
- `/qbo/accounts/all` - Get all accounts (including Undeposited Funds)
- `/qbo/payment-methods/all` - Get all payment methods

### 6. Project Restructuring
- Moved all source code to `src/` directory
- Created modular structure with separate route blueprints
- Organized utilities and services
- Added proper package initialization files

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Flask with Flask-Session
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis
- **Testing**: pytest with MockRedis
- **QBO Integration**: OAuth2 with intuitlib
- **AI Processing**: Google Gemini API
- **File Processing**: PIL/Pillow, PyMuPDF
- **Deployment**: Heroku with GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Current Status

### Working Features
- All tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Pre-commit hooks configured and working
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- File upload and processing endpoints
- QBO OAuth integration
- Customer matching functionality
- Async task processing with Celery

### Deployment Issue
The application successfully deploys to Heroku but crashes on startup with the error:
```
ValueError: QBO_CLIENT_ID and QBO_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables must be set
```

User stated: "all environment variables are already set on Heroku"

This discrepancy suggests either:
1. Environment variables may not be properly configured on Heroku
2. The application may not be reading them correctly
3. There might be a timing issue with environment variable loading

## Key Configuration Files

### Procfile
```
web: PYTHONPATH=src gunicorn src.app:app --timeout 300 --workers 2 --worker-class sync --max-requests 100 --max-requests-jitter 20 --graceful-timeout 30
worker: PYTHONPATH=src celery -A src.utils.celery_app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info --concurrency=1 --max-tasks-per-child=10
release: python scripts/utils/import_customers.py
```

### .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Runs linting, tests, security scans
- Builds Docker images
- Deploys to Heroku on master/heroku-deployment branches
- Includes retry logic for health checks

### Pre-commit Configuration
- Black with line-length=120
- isort, flake8, bandit, mypy
- All tests run before commit

## Next Steps (Not Requested)
While not explicitly requested, potential next steps could include:
1. Verify Heroku environment variables are properly set
2. Add logging to debug environment variable loading
3. Consider using Heroku config vars validation
4. Review application initialization order
