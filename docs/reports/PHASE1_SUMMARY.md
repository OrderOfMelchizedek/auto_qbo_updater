# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: Payment Extraction Refactor

## Overview
Successfully implemented the payment extraction refactor with Gemini structured outputs, transforming the donation-specific system into a general-purpose payment extraction system while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Created Pydantic Models (`src/models/payment.py`)
- **PaymentMethod** enum: Distinguishes between handwritten checks, printed checks, and online payments
- **PaymentInfo**: Structured payment details with validation
  - Enforces check numbers for check payments
  - Requires payment references for online payments
  - Validates date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **PayerInfo**: Flexible payer representation
  - Supports individual payers via aliases
  - Supports organizations
  - Validates that at least one type is provided
- **ContactInfo**: Standardized contact information
  - Auto-validates state codes (2 letters)
  - Normalizes ZIP codes (5 digits)
- **PaymentRecord**: Complete payment structure with conversion methods
  - `from_legacy_format()`: Converts old donation format to new
  - `to_legacy_format()`: Converts new format back to legacy

### 2. Implemented Structured Extraction (`src/utils/gemini_structured.py`)
- Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash model with structured output support
- Implements `response_mime_type: "application/json"` with Pydantic schemas
- Handles multiple document types (checks, envelopes, CSV files)
- Includes proper rate limiting and error handling
- Uploads images to Gemini API for processing
- Falls back to text parsing if structured parsing fails

### 3. Built Backward Compatibility (`src/utils/gemini_adapter.py`)
- **GeminiAdapter** class maintains exact GeminiService interface
- Feature flag (`use_structured`) to toggle between old/new extraction
- Automatic fallback to legacy extraction on errors
- Factory function `create_gemini_service()` for drop-in replacement
- All existing code continues to work unchanged

### 4. Created Structured Prompts (`docs/prompts_structured/`)
- `payment_extraction_prompt.md`: General payment extraction
- `check_extraction_prompt.md`: Check-specific rules and validation
- `envelope_extraction_prompt.md`: Address priority from envelopes
- `csv_extraction_prompt.md`: Online payment extraction from CSV

### 5. Enhanced Deduplication (`src/services/deduplication.py`)
- Added support for `payment_ref` field for online payments
- Online payments use key: `ONLINE_{payment_ref}_{amount}`
- Check payments use key: `CHECK_{check_no}_{amount}`
- Maintains all existing deduplication logic

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- `test_structured_extraction.py`: Unit tests for model conversions
- `test_integration.py`: End-to-end tests with real images
- Verified backward compatibility
- Tested deduplication with payment references

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Conversion Example
```python
# Legacy format
legacy = {
    "Donor Name": "John Smith",
    "Gift Amount": "100.00",
    "Check No.": "1234",
    "Check Date": "2025-05-01"
}

# Converts to PaymentRecord
payment = PaymentRecord.from_legacy_format(legacy)
# payment.payment_info.payment_method = PaymentMethod.HANDWRITTEN_CHECK
# payment.payment_info.amount = 100.0
# payment.payer_info.aliases = ["John Smith"]

# Converts back to legacy
legacy_format = payment.to_legacy_format()
# Preserves all original fields for compatibility
```

### Integration Points
1. **app.py**: Updated imports to use `create_gemini_service()`
2. **tasks.py**: Uses adapter for async processing
3. **file_processor.py**: Continues to work with legacy format
4. **deduplication.py**: Enhanced to handle payment references

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Type Safety**: Pydantic models ensure data validation
2. **Flexibility**: Supports multiple payment types and document formats
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes to existing code
4. **Future-Ready**: Foundation for expanding to other document types
5. **Better Accuracy**: Structured outputs reduce parsing errors
6. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between old and new code

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Remove customer matching from individual file processing
- Implement single-pass matching after deduplication
- Update terminology throughout codebase (donor â†’ payer)
- Continue testing with production data

## Files Modified/Created
- Created: 11 new files (models, services, prompts, tests)
- Modified: 6 existing files (minimal changes for integration)
- Added: pydantic==2.11.5 to requirements

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: All changes are backward compatible
- **Feature Flag**: Can disable structured extraction if issues arise
- **Fallback Logic**: Automatic fallback to legacy on errors
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests pass

The implementation successfully achieves all Phase 1 goals while maintaining stability and backward compatibility.
