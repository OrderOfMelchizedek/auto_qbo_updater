## Coverage Analysis

### Strengths üí™
1. **API Layer**: All route handlers have 78-90% coverage
2. **Core Services**: Business logic services are well-tested
3. **Data Validation**: Input validation has 97% coverage
4. **Integration Testing**: Good coverage of component interactions

### Areas for Improvement üéØ
1. **External Integrations**: QBO service (23%) and Gemini service (57%) need more tests
2. **Background Processing**: Celery tasks and async operations lack coverage
3. **Error Handling**: Exception classes and error paths need testing
4. **Infrastructure**: Configuration and deployment code lacks tests

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Increase QBO Service Coverage** (23% ‚Üí 70%)
   - Mock external API calls
   - Test error scenarios
   - Cover token refresh logic

2. **Improve File Processor Coverage** (22% ‚Üí 70%)
   - Test different file formats
   - Cover error handling paths
   - Test concurrent processing

### Medium Priority
3. **Add Background Task Tests**
   - Test Celery task execution
   - Cover task retry logic
   - Test result storage

4. **Enhance Error Handling Tests**
   - Test custom exceptions
   - Cover error recovery paths
   - Test logging behavior

### Low Priority
5. **Configuration Tests**
   - Validate configuration loading
   - Test environment variable handling
   - Cover edge cases

## Coverage Trends

This is the first comprehensive coverage report. Future reports should track:
- Coverage percentage changes
