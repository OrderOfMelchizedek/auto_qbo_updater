# QBO Integration Implementation Plan

## Current Status

We've successfully enhanced the QuickBooks Online backend integration with:

1. Improved error handling for invalid references
2. Added endpoints to create QuickBooks accounts, items, and payment methods
3. Implemented sales receipt preview functionality
4. Updated sales receipt creation to follow the required format:
   - Payment method: Check
   - Reference no: Check no.
   - Sales Receipt Date: Gift Date
   - Deposit To: 12000 Undeposited Funds
   - Service Date: Check Date
   - Customizable Product/Service
   - Description format: `Check No._Gift Date_Amount_LastName_FirstNames_Memo`
   - Message: "auto import on YYYY-MM-DD"
   - Receipt number: "YYYY-MM-DD_Check No."
5. Enhanced batch processing with:
   - Better validation for dates and amounts
   - Support for defaulting item references
   - Support for exclusions
   - Comprehensive error handling and reporting

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Client-side JavaScript for QBO Setup and Error Handling

- Enhance setup modal functionality to handle missing references:
  - Account references (particularly 12000 Undeposited Funds)
  - Item references (particularly "Gift - General - 503")
  - Payment method references (particularly "Check")
- Implement UI for creating new QBO references
- Create proper form validation for these operations

### 2. Implement Sales Receipt Preview UI

- Wire up frontend to use new preview endpoint
- Build receipt preview interface showing all formatted fields
- Include item selection dropdown populated from QBO items

### 3. Complete Batch Processing UI

- Add exclusion checkboxes for batch processing
- Create batch configuration UI with default item selection
- Improve results display with success/failure counts
- Add retry functionality for failed transactions

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery

- Implement recovery flows for specific error types
- Add modal displays for validation errors
- Create user-friendly error explanations
- Support special handling for duplicate document numbers

### 5. Frontend Validation Improvements

- Add client-side validation to prevent common QBO errors
- Implement date formatting helpers for consistent QBO date formats
- Create character limit validation for fields with QBO restrictions

### 6. Testing and Refinement

- Test with various error conditions
- Verify proper handling of missing references
- Ensure reference creation works correctly
- Test batch processing with mixed success/failure scenarios

## Implementation Priority

1. QBO setup modal functionality for alternative references
2. Item selection dropdowns throughout the application
3. Sales receipt preview UI before sending to QBO
