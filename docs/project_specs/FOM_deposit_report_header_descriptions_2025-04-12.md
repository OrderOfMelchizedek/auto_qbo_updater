# Deposit Report Headers

- **customerLookup**: The donor's unique ID used to look them up in the customer contact list. For an individual donor (or donor couple), it is usually the last and first names (e.g. Smith, John & Jane); for an organization (like a church), it will be the name plus the city it's in (e.g. St. John Lutheran Church Philadelphia).
- **Salutation**: This is how the donor is to be addressed (e.g. Mr. & Mrs., etc.). If it is a church, the salutation is 'Members of'.
- **Donor Name**: The name of the donor. Get this from the deposit scan.
- **Check No.**: The check number for the donation. Usually four digits (for personal checks) but sometimes can be more (especially for pre-printed checks).
- **Gift Amount**: The amount of the donation, found on the check. It will be written as a number and spelled out. Make absolutely certain that this is recorded accurately.
- **Check Date**: The date written on the check.
- **Gift Date**: Use the postmark on the envelope if the donation is a personal check. Use the check date if the donation is a printed check (which is usual for donations from organizations or churches) or if the donation is a personal check where the postmark on the envelope is illegible.
- **Deposit Date**: The date that the checks were deposited. Use the current date unless another date is specified.
- **Deposit Method**: ATM deposit by default. However can also be mobile deposit or online donation.
- **Memo**: Any memo written on the check, or a summary of any information included with the donation.
- **First Name**: The first name of the donor. If it is a donor couple, list both their names (John & Jane). Ensure it matches the customer contact list.
- **Last Name**: The last name of the donor. Ensure it matches the customer contact list.
- **Full Name**: The full name of the donor. Ensure it matches the customer contact list.
- **Organization Name**: The name of the organization making the donation. Get this from the customer contact list.
- **Address - Line 1**: The street address of the donor. Compare the return address listed on the scanned envelope with that in the customer contact list and note any discrepancy. The return address takes precedence over the address in the customer contact list; if it is different, then ensure the user is apprised so that the customer contact list can be updated.
- **City**: Address city
- **State**: The two-digit state code typically found in any U.S. address.
- **ZIP**: A five-digit numerical postal code typically found in any U.S. address. Sometimes there is an additional four-digit extension; this can usually be ignored. NOTE: Be sure to format this as text so that leading zeros are preserved.
