# Security Fix Plan for security-fixes Branch

## Security Issues Identified

After reviewing the recent changes, I've identified several security concerns that need to be addressed:

### 1. Session Management Issues
- **Issue**: Inconsistent session ID handling between Flask session and X-Session-ID header
- **Risk**: Potential session fixation or session hijacking
- **Location**: `/api/manual_match` endpoint uses X-Session-ID header while other endpoints use Flask session

### 2. Input Validation
- **Issue**: Limited input validation on user-supplied data
- **Risk**: Potential for injection attacks or malformed data processing
- **Locations**:
  - Customer ID input in manual_match endpoint
  - Search terms in search_customers and search_accounts
  - File upload names and content

### 3. Error Message Information Disclosure
- **Issue**: Detailed error messages exposed to users
- **Risk**: Information leakage that could aid attackers
- **Example**: QuickBooks API errors with full details returned to frontend

### 4. Logging Sensitive Data
- **Issue**: Potential logging of sensitive information
- **Risk**: Credentials or PII could be exposed in logs
- **Locations**: Various logger statements throughout the codebase

### 5. Frontend Security
- **Issue**: SearchableDropdown component doesn't escape user input
- **Risk**: Potential XSS if malicious data is returned from API
- **Location**: SearchableDropdown.tsx

### 6. Job Queue Security
- **Issue**: No authentication on job status endpoints
- **Risk**: Information disclosure about processing jobs
- **Location**: `/api/jobs/<job_id>` endpoint

### 7. File Upload Security
- **Issue**: Limited validation of uploaded file content
- **Risk**: Malicious file uploads could cause issues
- **Location**: `/api/upload` endpoint

## Proposed Security Fixes

### 1. Standardize Session Management
- Remove X-Session-ID header usage
- Use Flask session consistently across all endpoints
- Add session validation middleware
- Implement session timeout and rotation

### 2. Add Input Validation Layer
- Create input validation decorators for all endpoints
- Validate and sanitize:
  - Customer IDs (alphanumeric only)
  - Search terms (escape special characters)
  - File names (secure filename validation)
  - JSON payloads (schema validation)

### 3. Implement Secure Error Handling
- Create error response wrapper that sanitizes error messages
- Log detailed errors server-side only
- Return generic error messages to users
- Add error tracking for security events

### 4. Secure Logging Practices
- Implement secure logging filter to redact sensitive data
- Remove all logging of:
  - Access tokens
  - Refresh tokens
  - API keys
  - Full customer data
  - Payment information

### 5. Frontend Security Hardening
- Add HTML escaping to SearchableDropdown
- Implement Content Security Policy headers
- Add XSS protection headers
- Sanitize all API responses before rendering

### 6. Secure Job Queue Access
- Add authentication requirement for job status endpoints
- Validate job ownership before returning status
- Implement rate limiting on job endpoints
- Add job expiration

### 7. File Upload Security
- Implement strict file type validation
- Add virus scanning integration point
- Limit file sizes more strictly
- Validate image file headers
- Sanitize file names

### 8. Additional Security Measures
- Add CSRF protection to all state-changing endpoints
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Add security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- Create security audit logging
- Add input length limits
- Implement API versioning for future security updates

## Implementation Priority
1. **Critical**: Session management standardization
2. **High**: Input validation and sanitization
3. **High**: Secure error handling
4. **Medium**: Logging security
5. **Medium**: Frontend XSS protection
6. **Low**: Additional hardening measures

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for all validation functions
- Integration tests for session management
- Security scanning with OWASP ZAP
- Manual penetration testing of key endpoints

## Notes
This security audit was conducted on 2025-06-17 after implementing the following features:
- Replaced Celery with simple Redis job queue
- Fixed manual match authentication
- Implemented searchable dropdown for deposit accounts
- Added service date to sales receipts

The security-fixes branch was created to address these issues without affecting the production deployment.
