## Phase 1: Payment Extraction & QuickBooks Integration

### Overview
Transform the extraction system to use structured outputs and enrich payment data with QuickBooks customer information, creating a complete payment record for UI display.

### Goals
1. Extract payment data in structured format (Payment Info, Payer Info, Contact Info)
2. Match with QuickBooks customers and pull customer data
3. Compare addresses and determine if QBO needs updating
4. Handle email/phone updates intelligently
5. Create final combined JSON for UI display

### Implementation Steps

#### 1.1 Activate Structured Extraction (PRIORITY)
- ✅ Enable GeminiAdapter in app initialization - ALREADY ACTIVE
- ☐ Test structured extraction with real files
- ☐ Verify the following fields are extracted:
  ```json
  {
    "payment_info": {
      "payment_method": "handwritten_check|printed_check|online_payment",
      "check_no": "1234",  // REQUIRED for checks
      "payment_ref": "REF123",  // REQUIRED for online
      "amount": 500.00,  // REQUIRED
      "payment_date": "2025-05-30",  // REQUIRED
      "check_date": "2025-05-28",
      "postmark_date": "2025-05-29",
      "deposit_date": "2025-05-30",
      "deposit_method": "ATM Deposit",
      "memo": "Annual contribution"
    },
    "payer_info": {
      "aliases": ["John Smith", "Smith, John"],  // REQUIRED for individuals
      "salutation": "Mr.",
      "organization_name": "Smith Foundation"  // REQUIRED for orgs
    },
    "contact_info": {
      "address_line_1": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "state": "IL",
      "zip": "62701",  // 5 digits, preserve leading zeros
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "(555) 123-4567"
    }
  }
  ```

#### 1.2 Enhance QBO Customer Matching
- ✅ Created `qbo_data_enrichment.py` service with full field extraction
- ✅ Update `match_donations_with_qbo_customers_batch()` to:
  - ☐ Use payer aliases for matching individuals
  - ☐ Use organization_name for matching organizations
  - ✅ Pull ALL customer fields from QBO:
    ```python
    qbo_customer_data = {
        "customer_lookup": customer.get("DisplayName"),
        "first_name": customer.get("GivenName"),
        "last_name": customer.get("FamilyName"),
        "full_name": customer.get("FullyQualifiedName"),
        "qb_organization_name": customer.get("CompanyName"),
        "qb_address_line_1": bill_addr.get("Line1"),
        "qb_city": bill_addr.get("City"),
        "qb_state": bill_addr.get("CountrySubDivisionCode"),
        "qb_zip": bill_addr.get("PostalCode"),
        "qb_email": customer.get("PrimaryEmailAddr", {}).get("Address"),
        "qb_phone": customer.get("PrimaryPhone", {}).get("FreeFormNumber")
    }
    ```

#### 1.3 Implement Address Comparison Logic
- ✅ Create `address_comparison.py` service - IMPLEMENTED in `qbo_data_enrichment.py`:
  - ✅ Compare extracted vs QBO addresses
  - ✅ Character-level comparison for Address Line 1
  - ✅ If >50% characters differ, flag for update
  - ✅ Handle ZIP code normalization (5 digits only)
  - ✅ Return comparison result with update flag

#### 1.4 Implement Smart Email/Phone Updates
- ✅ Create update logic - IMPLEMENTED in `qbo_data_enrichment.py`:
  - ✅ If QB has no email/phone but extracted does → UPDATE
  - ✅ If QB has email/phone and extracted matches → KEEP QB
  - ✅ If QB has email/phone and extracted differs → ADD to list
  - ✅ Support email/phone as lists in data model

#### 1.5 Create Final Combined JSON Output
- ✅ Create `payment_combiner.py` service to merge:
  ```json
  {
    "payer_info": {
      "customer_lookup": "John Smith",  // From QBO
      "salutation": "Mr.",  // From extraction
      "first_name": "John",  // From QBO
      "last_name": "Smith",  // From QBO
      "full_name": "John Smith",  // From QBO
      "qb_organization_name": null,  // From QBO
      "qb_address_line_1": "123 Main St",  // From QBO
      "qb_city": "Springfield",  // From QBO
      "qb_state": "IL",  // From QBO
      "qb_zip": "62701",  // From QBO
      "qb_email": ["john@example.com"],  // List from QBO
      "qb_phone": ["(555) 123-4567"],  // List from QBO
      "address_needs_update": false,  // Computed
      "extracted_address": {  // For comparison
        "line_1": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Springfield",
        "state": "IL",
        "zip": "62701"
      }
    },
    "payment_info": {
      "check_no_or_payment_ref": "1234",  // check_no OR payment_ref
      "amount": 500.00,
      "payment_date": "2025-05-30",
      "deposit_date": "2025-05-30",
      "deposit_method": "ATM Deposit",
      "memo": "Annual contribution"
    },
    "match_status": "Matched",  // or "New", "Matched-AddressNeedsReview"
    "qbo_customer_id": "123"  // For updates
  }
  ```

#### 1.6 Update Deduplication for Payment References
- ✅ Already implemented in deduplication.py:
  - ✅ Online payments use `ONLINE_{payment_ref}_{amount}` key
  - ✅ Check payments use `CHECK_{check_no}_{amount}` key

#### 1.7 Testing Phase 1
- ☐ Test structured extraction with sample files
- ✅ Test QBO data enrichment - All unit tests passing
- ✅ Test address comparison logic - All unit tests passing
- ✅ Test email/phone update logic - All unit tests passing
- ✅ Verify final JSON structure - All unit tests passing
- ☐ Test backward compatibility
- ✅ Created `enhanced_file_processor.py` for integration
- ✅ Updated app.py to use EnhancedFileProcessor - QBO enrichment features now active

---

## Phase 2: Customer Matching Refactor - ✅ COMPLETE

### Accomplishments
- ✅ Removed matching from individual file processing
- ✅ Centralized matching after deduplication

## Phase 3: Frontend and API Updates

### Overview
Update user-facing components to use the new combined JSON structure.

### Implementation Steps

#### 3.1 API Response Updates
- ☐ Update `/api/process` to return new JSON structure
- ☐ Ensure backward compatibility with adapters
- ☐ Add field mapping for UI display

#### 3.2 Frontend Display Updates

  - ☐ Customer Name (customer_lookup)
  - ☐ Check/Ref # (check_no_or_payment_ref)
  - ☐ Amount
  - ☐ Payment Date
  - ☐ Address Status (icon if needs update)
- ☐ Add address update indicator
- ☐ Show email/phone lists properly

#### 3.3 QBO Update Interface
- ☐ Add "Update QBO" button for flagged addresses
- ☐ Show before/after address comparison
- ☐ Allow user to confirm updates
- ☐ Update customer record in QBO

---

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Activate structured extraction** - Critical foundation
2. **Test with real files** - Verify extraction works
3. **Implement QBO data pull** - Get customer fields
4. **Create address comparison** - Core business logic

### Next (Week 2)
1. **Email/phone update logic** - Smart updates
2. **Final JSON combiner** - Merge all data
3. **API response updates** - Send to frontend
4. **Frontend updates** - Display new data

### Later (Week 3)
1. **QBO update interface** - Allow user updates
2. **Comprehensive testing** - End-to-end
3. **Documentation** - Update all docs
4. **Deployment** - Staged rollout

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### ZIP Code Handling
- Always store as 5-digit string
- Preserve leading zeros
- Ignore +4 extension
- Normalize before comparison

### Email/Phone as Lists
- QBO customers can have multiple emails/phones
- Primary is first in list
- Add new ones instead of replacing
- Display all in UI

### Address Update Logic
- >50% character difference triggers update flag
- User must confirm before updating QBO
- Keep audit trail of changes
- Show side-by-side comparison

### Match Status Values
- "Matched" - Found and verified
- "Matched-AddressNeedsReview" - Found but address differs
- "New" - No match found
- Include confidence scores
