# Summary of Fixes Applied

## Issues Investigated

1. **Authentication showing as missing even though user went through OAuth flow**
2. **/save and /report/generate routes returning 404**
3. **Disconnect between frontend expectations and backend routes**

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Token Persistence Issue**: After OAuth callback, tokens were stored in Redis but the QBOService instance in memory wasn't aware of them. The auth_status route was checking if the service had tokens, not just the session.

2. **Missing Routes**: The `/save` and `/report/generate` routes were removed during the modularization refactor but the frontend still expected them.

3. **Missing QBO Service Methods**: Several methods were missing from the QBO service:
   - `get_company_info()`
   - `get_customer_by_id()`
   - The `update_customer()` method had incorrect parameter expectations

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Token Loading from Redis
- Modified `/qbo/auth-status` route to reload tokens from Redis when checking authentication status
- Modified `get_qbo_service()` helper in qbo routes to always reload tokens from Redis before returning the service

**Files modified:**
- `/src/routes/auth.py` - Added `_load_tokens_from_redis()` call in auth_status route
- `/src/routes/qbo.py` - Added token reload in get_qbo_service helper

### 2. Restored Missing Routes
- Added `/save` route to save donation data to session
- Added `/report/generate` route to generate donation reports
- These routes were added directly to app.py as the frontend expects them at the root level

**Files modified:**
- `/src/app.py` - Added save_changes() and generate_report() routes

### 3. Added Missing QBO Service Methods
- Added `get_company_info()` method to QBOEntityService
- Added `get_customer_by_id()` method to QBOCustomerService
- Fixed `update_customer()` route to properly fetch SyncToken before updating
- Added delegation methods to QBOService facade class

**Files modified:**
- `/src/utils/qbo_service/__init__.py` - Added delegation methods
- `/src/utils/qbo_service/entities.py` - Added get_company_info()
- `/src/utils/qbo_service/customers.py` - Added get_customer_by_id()
- `/src/routes/qbo.py` - Fixed update_customer route to fetch existing customer first

## Testing

- Created comprehensive tests for the new routes in `test_donations_routes_extended.py`
- All tests pass successfully
- Auth status tests confirm the token loading fix works

## Result

The application should now:
1. Properly recognize when a user is authenticated with QuickBooks
2. Handle /save and /report/generate requests without 404 errors
3. Successfully interact with QuickBooks API for all customer operations

The authentication flow now works as follows:
1. User initiates OAuth through `/qbo/authorize`
2. QuickBooks redirects to `/qbo/callback` with authorization code
3. Tokens are exchanged and stored in both session and Redis
4. When checking auth status, tokens are reloaded from Redis to ensure consistency
5. All QBO API calls reload tokens from Redis before making requests
